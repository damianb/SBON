# SBON

## A node.js library for working with the "SBON" format (Starbound Binary Object Notation).

### What is SBON?

"SBON" is the community-created name for what appears to be a proprietary binary format, created by ChuckleFish for the game Starbound.
It seems to be highly like JSON and potentially a derivative of JSON/BSON.

For some documentation, see the reverse engineering notes on SBON, [available here](https://github.com/blixt/py-starbound/blob/master/FORMATS.md#sbon).

### How do I install this library?

Ensure you have at least node.js v7.6+, and then...

``` bash
$ yarn add sbon
```

### How do I use this library?

Reference the [documentation](https://damianb.github.io/SBON/).
